# Audio Captcha Solver

An Audio Captcha Solver is a tool designed to automatically solve audio-based CAPTCHA challenges commonly used on websites to verify human users and prevent bots. This project focuses on recognizing and transcribing audio captchas using various techniques such as audio processing and speech recognition.

## Features

- Processes audio CAPTCHA files to transcribe spoken characters or numbers.
- Supports common audio CAPTCHA formats.
- Uses modern speech recognition APIs or libraries.
- Can be customized or extended for better accuracy.
- Designed for educational and research purposes.

## How It Works

The solver takes an audio CAPTCHA input, processes the audio to enhance clarity, and uses speech recognition techniques to extract the CAPTCHA text. The transcribed output can then be used for automated form submission or testing.

## About the Model

This project includes a custom-trained model hosted on Hugging Face: [partthdhiman/captcha-solver](https://huggingface.co/partthdhiman/captcha-solver).

The model is trained specifically to tackle audio CAPTCHAs, optimizing transcription accuracy on these challenging datasets. It leverages state-of-the-art speech processing techniques.

You can load and use the model and processor directly in your Python code as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForCTC

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("partthdhiman/captcha-solver")
model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained("partthdhiman/captcha-solver")
